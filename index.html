      <p>
        Welcome! I am Lionel Di Giacomo, an Automattic Happiness engineer and currently retired freelance web developer, digital mechanic, and tiny web host. I have worked with websites for twenty years and enjoy helping artists, nonprofits, and small heartfelt businesses get simple and functional websites up and running with minimal fuss.</p>
      <p>
        <img class="img--inline" src="assets/techlogos/wordpress_logo.png" alt="">
        <strong>I emphasize empowerment.</strong> I want you to be comfortable updating your own website. The web is a great publishing tool, but too many people get stuck with a website they can't edit themselves. With a little guidance up front, you can be in control of your content.</p>
      <p>
        <img class="img--inline" src="assets/techlogos/vue_logo.png" alt="">
        <strong>I support open-source.</strong> I prefer using open source platforms and software for most projects because they are durable, community-supported solutions. Additionally, by using popular technology my work can be more easily picked up and modified by future developers.</p>
      <p>
        I often choose WordPress because it is popular, open source, and has loads of options. Among frontend frameworks, I enjoy Vue.js for its independent community, flexibility, and rapid growth. I also contribute issues, documentation, and sometimes development to open source projects (<a href="https://github.com/melek/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my github</a>)</p>      
      <p>
        <strong>I can adapt to your project.</strong> I like learning new technologies and have worked on numerous projects with proprietary solutions like Shopify, Squarespace, Hubspot, and more.</p>

      <h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio: Projects and Clients</h2>
      <p>Apart from my work at Automattic, I have worked on projects of all sizes with diverse clients ranging from small single-page donation portals for nonprofits to specialized web applications for small businesses and large e-commerce sites. These are all live projects where I served as a developer and consultant.</p>

      <p>Button Poetry is an independent poetry publisher with an audience of over 1 million poetry fans worldwide.
